# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Immanuel Pettigrew Golf 22'

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is instructions for the computer to execute, with an expected outcome, which is also based on inputs.

Researched answer: --> Programming is the art of solving very complex problems or processes by breaking each problem into 
                    tiny, solvable pieces.In development, conditionals statements are commands for handling decisions. Specifically, conditionals perform different actions depending on whether the outcome of a Boolean condition evaluates to true or false.

                    A conditional statement is defined by the JavaScript keyword if. The if function takes a statement to be evaluated. If the statement evaluates to the Boolean value of true, the corresponding code statement will be executed.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is software used on my computer, it also alllows computer to interact with gitHub, which is cloudbased storage for code.
            (i.e. Music on my iPod and storing "my" music on iCloud music account through Apple. Hopefully, gitHub will not alter or steal my items)

Researched answer:--> Git is a free, open-sourced version control system widely used in the programming world. It is a very powerful      
                  tool used for sharing and working on code and allows for many people to contribute to the same code base. Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, to track changes in source code. Git is accessed primarily through the command line.

                    GitHub offers free and paid products for storing and collaborating on code. Some products apply only to personal accounts, while other plans apply only to organization and enterprise accounts. For more information about accounts, see "Types of GitHub accounts."

                    With GitHub Free for personal accounts, you can work with unlimited collaborators on unlimited public repositories with a full feature set, and on unlimited private repositories with a limited feature set.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

    Your answer: Javascript operators that comes to mind are the && and === operators that return one result. Boolean value one result. 

Researched answer:--> Boolean expressions in JavaScript return true or false. Even though true and false are words they are not strings.  
                    They represent the value of true/false.

                    Boolean values are very useful when making evaluations about data. Equality operators compare one value to the other and judge if the values equate to the same thing. If they do equate to the same a Boolean value of true is returned if not we get a Boolean value of false. There are two types of equality operators, the loose equality operator and the strict equality operator. The loose equality operator converts the two items to the same data type before making a comparison and the strict equality operator requires the two items being compared must be the same data type to return true.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index, is zero-based, represented in arrays. Each index has an value. Still understanding the link between value and index.

Researched answer:--> Value
                    Each element in the array must be a JavaScript data type. The content of each element is called the value.

                      Index
                    Every value in an array has a particular location known as the index. Indexes are sequential numbers that are a bit like an address for every element in the array. Arrays are zero indexed which means the elements are numbered starting with the number 0 and increase by one whole number for each new element.

                      Accessing Elements
                    One of the many benefits to storing data in arrays is that we can access the individual values. Since the indexes are like an address, we can reference the variable that holds the entire array and the specific index in square brackets in order to retrieve the value. If the index does not exist the output will be undefined.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Both arrays and strings are zero indexed based, allowing access through built in methods. 

Researched answer:--> An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
                    JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.
                    A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming involves two developers. One role is the driver, which types in commands form the navigator, which is the 
            second role. Pair programming ensures a checks an balance between the two. Also, transactional knowledge is conducted. Each member are aware of each others' responsibility.

Researched answer: Pair Programming
An important part of being successful in a remote dev team is effective pair programming.

Why We Utilize Pair Programming
Different people have different knowledge and strengths which can lead to better solutions
Distributing cognitive load and use individualized skills (typing syntax vs. problem solving) when driving and navigating
Coding can feel overwhelming, so focusing on one aspect of the job at hand can help focus energy on problem solving
Two sets of eyes makes it easier to catch mistakes and produce high-quality code
A pair can hold each other accountable so you'll be less likely to be tempted to take shortcuts or jump around without finishing the task you are on
Partners help keep the focus on coding and not on distractions like texts, emails, etc
Talking about your code with a partner will deepen your understanding of programming
Increased specialization requires more collaboration
Roles: Driver and Navigator
The driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard. They are responsible for entering information and following the instructions given by the navigator. This approach requires constant communication. And talking about your code will make you a better developer and a better teammate. It is important to switch roles every 10-20 minutes and take frequent breaks.

Step 1: Getting Your Pair
Pairs or mobs will be determined by instructors.

Step 2: Planning
Once in the breakout room, take a few minutes to read through the necessary material. Make sure everyone on the team understands the full objective of the challenge. Discuss the technologies needed to accomplish the goal at hand. If the project has a larger scope, utilize wireframes in your planning session.

Step 3: Technology Set Up
After your team has decided on the technology to be used, select who will be the first driver and who will be the first navigator. With the navigators direction, the driver will share his/her screen and begin to code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-Order Functions

                            A higher-order function is a built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument. Often higher-order functions are designed to operate on arrays. The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array. This makes higher-order functions incredible useful for iteration.

2. Jest: Jest

            Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. The Jest framework is made up of a collection of files called dependencies which contain snippets of code functionality. Using all these code snippets together in the right way will give us the ability to run tests. There are many dependencies to manage and all need to work together in exactly the right way. This is a challenge on its own so in 2016 Facebook created a package manager called yarn to manage all the dependency files. A package manager will install dependencies, manage the dependencies, and give us the terminal commands to execute the tests.

3. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as 
            actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.

4. Method: Method definition is a shorter syntax for defining a function property in an object initializer.

5. Classes: Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects. Just like 
            functions, classes have their own scope. There are particular JavaScript keywords that are used to create and access information within a class:
                            - constructor: a special method for creating and initializing objects
                            - this: a JavaScript keyword that refers to the object it belongs to
                            - new: used when creating a new instance of a class (an object)
