# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Immanuel Pettigrew Golf 22'

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is instructions for the computer to execute, with an expected outcome, which is also based on inputs.

Researched answer: --> An conditional statement defined by Javascript key word if, evalutes whether the statement evalutes to true. We can set conditional statements to evaluate additional options with Javascript keywords else/if, and end all statements with Javascript keyword Else.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is software used on my computer, it also alllows computer to interact with gitHub, which is cloudbased storage for code.
            (i.e. Music on my iPod and storing "my" music on iCloud music account through Apple. Hopefully, gitHub will not alter or steal my items)

Researched answer:--> Git is software in my local machine, which via command line terminal can access GitHub. GitHub is a cloudbase storage platform which host and perform similiar functions and features as our own personal machine. Git software is needed to interact with GitHub.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

    Your answer: Javascript operators that comes to mind are the && and === operators that return one result. Boolean value one result. 

Researched answer:--> Boolean expressions return tru or false. Equality operators are the best type operator ton describe a Boolean. the == evaluates and gives the benefit of the doubt. However, an === strict equality will only return the Boolean value true or false. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index, is zero-based, represented in arrays. Each index has an value. Still understanding the link between value and index.

Researched answer:--> A value in an array or string has a position, that position is know as a index. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Both arrays and strings are zero indexed based, allowing access through built in methods. 

Researched answer:--> Arrays and strings share many similarities, I've learned they both are a collection of items,have a length property, and zero based.difference is : arrays can hold large elements of strings. String are the characters interpreted on screen. Arrays is an container which strings can be accessed.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming involves two developers. One role is the driver, which types in commands form the navigator, which is the 
            second role. Pair programming ensures a checks an balance between the two. Also, transactional knowledge is conducted. Each member are aware of each others' responsibility.

Researched answer: Pair programming is an intense skill builder. Pair programming is designed to break the simulate real world setting. Pair programming reinenforces learning and correction between the pair.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-Order Functions

                            A higher-order function is a built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument.
2. Jest: 
            Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. The Jest framework is checks and balance scale for higher order functions. Puts in place the practice of debugging.

3. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. 

4. Method: Method is a built in tool, that can perform functions that does not have to be created by the user.

5. Classes: Classes are a blueprint of a object of an idea that can be created. A class can have standard foundation, new items or objects can be created using the blueprint.
